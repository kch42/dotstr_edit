If you want to create a MS-Windows EXE file, just run the "exefying.bat" Batch-File.
Additional stuff you need for this:
* py2exe
* 7-Zip (optional)
* UPX (optional)
7-Zip and UPX are only needed, if you want to compress the EXE (and its libbrary.zip).
If you don't want compression, edit exefying.bat and find:

REM  Uncomment next line, if you do not want to compress...
REM  goto end

and change to:

REM  Uncomment next line, if you do not want to compress...
goto end

The finished EXE file (and everything that this EXE needs) is now located in the directory "dist".

You can also build an Installer using NSIS.
Before compiling the setup.nsi file, you need to download vcredist_x86.exe and put  it into the directory "redist".
You can get "vcredist_x86.exe" here:
